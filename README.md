Simple PHP Website

This php website has a database access. Login and table information can be found on the index.php file. Feel free to edit them.
This is also a jinja (j2) file, so use ansible to swap some of the entries with ansible templates module.

This github repo is good to show website rolling update demo (v1 -> v2 -> v3) and rollback.
